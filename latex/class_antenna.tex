\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class simulates an antenna (a base transceiver station, or shortly B\+TS) of the mobile phone network. It has a fixed location on the map and registers the events generated by the interaction with the mobile devices in a .csv file. Each antenna has its own file where it saves the events and the name of this file. The name of this file is composed by concatenating \char`\"{}\+Antenna\char`\"{}, its id, \char`\"{}\+\_\+\+M\+N\+O\+\_\+\char`\"{} and the M\+NO name read from the configuration file. The are two types of antennas\+: omnidirectional and directional. An omnidirectional antenna emits homogeneous signal in all directions. We model the signal using two measures\+: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the signal strength \item the signal dominance\end{DoxyItemize}
The signal strength at distance {\itshape r} from the antenna\textquotesingle{}s location is given by \+:

$ RSS(r) = 30 + 10 log10(P) - 10 gamma log10(r)$ where P is the power of the antenna in Watts, while the signal dominance is given by\+:

$ SDM(r) = 1/(1 + exp (-Ssteep ( RSS(r) - Smid)))$

where Ssteep and Smid are parameters that should be given in the coonfiguration file. For a complete definition of the signal dominance one can consult\+: Tennekes M, Gootzen Y\+A\+PM, Shah SH (2020) A Bayesian approach to location estimation of mobile devices from mobile network operator data. Research Report, Statistics Netherlands (C\+BS). A directional antenna has a specific signal emission pattern and one can find a description of it in the work mentioned above. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
