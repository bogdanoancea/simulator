/**
 * This class is an enumeration of network events currently registered:
 * ATTACH_DEVICE - means that an antenna connects a new mobile device.
 * DETACH_DEVICE - means that an antenna disconnects a mobile device, i.e. this mobile device is no longer connected to that antenna.
 * ALREADY_ATTACHED_DEVICE - means that an antenna is connected with a mobile device and that mobile was connected to the same antenna
 * in the previous time step too.
 * IN_RANGE_NOT_ATTACHED_DEVICE - means that a mobile device tried to connect to an antenna, the antenna provided enough signal power/quality
 * but the connection was not successful (for example antenna is at its maximum capacity and cannot connect any new devices).
