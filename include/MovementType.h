/**
 * An enum class that enumerates the types of the methods used to move the people on the map.
 * RANDOM_WALK_CLOSED_MAP - the agent moves randomly inside the map boundary. The direction is generated
 * as a random value at each time step and the step length is computed multiplying the speed with the time interval.
 * RANDOM_WALK_CLOSED_MAP_WITH_DRIFT:  the agent moves in a preferential direction. There are two constants defining these directions:
 * SIM_TREND_ANGLE_1 and SIM_TREND_ANGLE_2 (3PI/4 and 5PI/4). The actual direction is generated as a normally distributed random
 * value with means equals to these constants and sad = 0.1.
