		 * object creation and currently two strategies are supported: RandomWalkDisplacement and RandomWalkDriftDisplacement.
		 *  RandomWalkDisplacement means
		 * that at each time instant the direction is generated as a uniformly distributed random value and the
		 * step length is computed multiplying the speed with the time interval set in the simulation configuration file.
		 * If a step projects it outside the map, it stops on the boundary.
		 * RandomWalkDriftDisplacement means that there is a preference in the direction of the movement.
		 * There are two constants defined, SIM_TREND_ANGLE_1 and SIM_TREND_ANGLE_2 (3PI/4 and 5PI/4), and in the first half
		 * of the simulation the direction is generated as a normal distributed random value with the mean equals to SIM_TREND_ANGLE_1 and
		 * sd = 0.1 while during the second half of the simulation it is generated as a normal distributed random value
		 * with the mean equals to SIM_TREND_ANGLE_2 and the same sd. Again, any kind of MovableAgent can only move inside the map boundary.
