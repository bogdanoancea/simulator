ALREADY_ATTACHED_DEVICE - means that an antenna is connected with a mobile device and that mobile was connected to the same antenna in the previous time step too\&. IN_RANGE_NOT_ATTACHED_DEVICE - means that a mobile device tried to connect to an antenna, the antenna provided enough signal power/quality but the connection was not successful (for example antenna is at its maximum capacity and cannot connect any new devices)\&.
