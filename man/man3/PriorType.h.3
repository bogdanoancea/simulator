An enum class that enumerates the types of the prior used to computed the posterior localization probability\&. UNIFORM : the prior is an uniform probability, i\&.e\&. each object is equally located in each tile of the map\&. REGISTER: the prior probability is given by an administrative register\&. NETWORK: the prior probability is given by the mobile network - it is computed as the ratio between the signal quality given by \fBAntenna\fP a in tile t and the sum of the signal quality given by all antennas in all tiles of the grid\&.
