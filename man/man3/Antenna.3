.PP 
This class simulates an antenna (a base transceiver station, or shortly BTS) of the mobile phone network\&. It has a fixed location on the map and registers the events generated by the interaction with the mobile devices in a \&.csv file\&. Each antenna has its own file where it saves the events and the name of this file\&. The name of this file is composed by concatenating 'Antenna', its id, '_MNO_' and the MNO name read from the configuration file\&. The are two types of antennas: omnidirectional and directional\&. An omnidirectional antenna emits homogeneous signal in all directions\&. We model the signal using two measures: 
.PD 0

.IP "\(bu" 2
the signal strength 
.IP "\(bu" 2
the signal dominance
.PP
The signal strength at distance \fIr\fP from the antenna's location is given by :
.PP
$ RSS(r) = 30 + 10 log10(P) - 10 gamma log10(r)$ where P is the power of the antenna in Watts, while the signal dominance is given by:
.PP
$ SDM(r) = 1/(1 + exp (-Ssteep ( RSS(r) - Smid)))$.PP
where Ssteep and Smid are parameters that should be given in the coonfiguration file\&. For a complete definition of the signal dominance one can consult: Tennekes M, Gootzen YAPM, Shah SH (2020) A Bayesian approach to location estimation of mobile devices from mobile network operator data\&. Research Report, Statistics Netherlands (CBS)\&. A directional antenna has a specific signal emission pattern and one can find a description of it in the work mentioned above\&.
