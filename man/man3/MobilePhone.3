.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This class represents a mobile phone\&. A mobile phone is owned by a \fBPerson\fP object and it moves on the map together with its owner\&. While moving, at every time step, when a new location is set, it interacts with surrounding antennas, trying to connect to the antenna that provides the best signal in terms of signal strength/dominance, according to the handover mechanism read from the simulation configuration file\&. The connection event is triggered by the call of \fBsetLocation()\fP\&.

.SS "bool MobilePhone::tryConnect ()\fC [override]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
This method is called after the mobile phone moves (together with its owner) to a new location\&. It tries to connect the mobile phone to an antenna\&. The connection method is determined by inspecting the \fIm_connType\fP member: using the signal dominance or using the signal strength\&. The value of the \fIm_connType\fP member is set by the constructor of the class\&. If the connection is successfully, a pointer to the \fBAntenna\fP object where this mobile phone was connected is stored internally\&. First, if the mobile phone is already connected to an antenna, this method checks if the mobile phone is still providing a signal strong enough for a connection and if not it detaches from that antenna\&. Then it selects the antenna providing the best signal (in terms of signal strength or dominance) and tries to connect to it\&. If the connection is successful it saves a pointer to that \fBAntenna\fP object\&. If this antenna reject the connection( for example it reached its maximum number of simultaneous connections) then a list of all other antennas is build, ordered by the signal strength/dominance\&. The mobile phone iterates through this list and tries to connect to an antenna\&. If one antenna accepts the incoming connection the method returns true, otherwise it returns false\&. When a connection is established, the pointer to the \fBAntenna\fP object is updated accordingly\&.
