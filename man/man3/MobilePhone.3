.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This class represents a mobile phone\&. A mobile phone is own by a \fBPerson\fP and it moves on the map together with its owner\&. While moving, at every time step it tries to connect to an antenna\&. The connection event is triggered by \fBsetLocation()\fP\&. The connection to antenna is determined by the signal emitted by antennas\&. A parameter in the simulation configuration file set the criterion used to connect: the power of the signal, the signal strength or the signal quality\&.

Builds a new MobilewPhone object with the parameters provided by the user\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIm\fP a pointer to the \fBMap\fP object where the simulation takes place\&. 
.br
\fIid\fP the id of the mobile phone\&. 
.br
\fIinitPosition\fP the initial location of the phone on the map\&. 
.br
\fIholder\fP a pointer to the \fBAgent\fP object that owns this mobile phone\&. 
.br
\fIclock\fP a pointer to the \fBClock\fP object used in this simulation\&. 
.br
\fIthreshold\fP the minimum power, signal qaulity or signal strength of the field below which the mobile phone cannot connect to an antenna\&. 
.br
\fIconnType\fP the criterion used for the connection to an antenna: based on the power of the signal or based on the signal quality\&. It could take three values: HoldableAgent::CONNECTION_TYPE::USING_POWER, HoldableAgent::CONNECTION_TYPE::USING_SIGNAL_QUALITY or HoldableAgent::CONNECTION_TYPE::USING_SIGNAL_STRENGTH\&.

.SS "double MobilePhone::getConnectionThreshold () const"
Returns the minimum value of the signal strength/power/quality below which the phone cannot use the signal (i\&.e\&. the signal is considered noise)\&. The returned value is interpreted as signal strength, power or quality according to the connection type\&.

\fBReturns:\fP

.SS "Point* MobilePhone::move ()\fC [inline]\fP, \fC [override]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
Makes a step on the map according to an algorithm\&. The direction and the length of the step is determined by the displacement strategy and by the \fBPerson\fP object who owns this phone\&. The displacement strategy is set at the \fBPerson\fP object creation and currently two strategies are supported: \fBRandomWalkDisplacement\fP and \fBRandomWalkDriftDisplacement\fP\&. \fBRandomWalkDisplacement\fP means that at each time instant the direction is generated as a uniformly distributed random value and the step length is computed multiplying the speed with the time interval set in the simulation configuration file\&. If a step projects it outside the map, it stops on the boundary\&. \fBRandomWalkDriftDisplacement\fP means that there is a preference in the direction of the movement\&. There are two constants defined, SIM_TREND_ANGLE_1 and SIM_TREND_ANGLE_2 (3PI/4 and 5PI/4), and in the first half of the simulation the direction is generated as a normal distributed random value with the mean equals to SIM_TREND_ANGLE_1 and sd = 0\&.1 while during the second half of the simulation it is generated as a normal distributed random value with the mean equals to SIM_TREND_ANGLE_2 and the same sd\&. Again, any kind of \fBMovableAgent\fP can only move inside the map boundary\&. If a step projects it outside the map, it stops on the boundary\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the final location after the displacement\&.

Reimplemented from \fBHoldableAgent\fP\&.
.SS "bool MobilePhone::tryConnect ()\fC [override]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
This method is called after the phone moves (together with its owner) to a new location\&. It tries to connect the mobile phone to an antenna\&. The connection method is determined by inspecting the m_connType: using the power of the signal, using the quality of the signal or using the signal strength\&. The value of the m_connType is set by the constructor of the class\&. If the connection is successfully a pointer to the \fBAntenna\fP object where this mobile phone was connected is stored internally\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
true if the connection succeeds, false otherwise\&.
