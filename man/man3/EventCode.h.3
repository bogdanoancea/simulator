This class is an enumeration of network events currently registered: ATTACH_DEVICE - means that an antenna (base station) connects a new mobile device\&. DETACH_DEVICE - means that an antenna (base station) disconnects a mobile device, i\&.e\&. this mobile device is no longer connected to that antenna\&. ALREADY_ATTACHED_DEVICE - means that an antenna (base station) is connected with a mobile device and that mobile was connected to the same antenna in the previous time step too\&. IN_RANGE_NOT_ATTACHED_DEVICE - means that a mobile device tried to connect to an antenna (base station), the antenna provided enough signal strength/quality but the connection was not successful (for example antenna is at its maximum capacity and cannot connect any new devices)\&.
