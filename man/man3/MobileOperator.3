.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This class represents a Mobile Operator company\&. Currently a simulation can be run with 1 or 2 mobile operators\&. A mobile operator owns a set of antennas and has a set of mobile phone subscribed\&. It has a name read from the simulation configuration file and two ofstream members representing the files where the cell boundaries and signal strength/dominance are saved for all antennas belonging to this mobile operator\&. It also has a member representing the probability of a person to have a mobile phone subscribed to this mobile network operator\&. The value of this probability is read from the simulation configuration file\&. 
.SH "Constructor & Destructor Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "MobileOperator::MobileOperator (const \fBMap\fP * m, const unsigned long id, const \fBClock\fP * clock, const char * name, const double probMobilePhone, const string & outputDir)"
Constructor of this class\&. It builds a \fBMobileOperator\fP object with the characteristics provided by user through the parameters of the constructor\&. In the process of creating the object, the constructor method builds a string representing the name of the file where the coverage area of all the antennas (cell boundary) that belong to this \fBMobileOperator\fP are saved in \&.csv format, then open this file and writes the header of the file\&. The name of this file is built by concatenating 'AntennaCells_' with the name of the Mobile Operator\&. A line of this file contains the antenna id followed by a \fCwkt\fP text representing the coverage area of antenna\&. It also builds another string representing the name of a file where the signal strength/dominance values for all antennas that belong to this \fBMobileOperator\fP are saved\&. The signal strength/dominance is computed in the center of each tile of the \fBGrid\fP object set for a simulation\&. The file is opened and then it writes the header of the file\&. The name of this file is built by concatenating 'SignalMeasure_' with the name of the Mobile Operator\&. A line of this file contains the antenna id followed by a set of values for the signal strength/dominance computed in the center of each tile of the grid\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters\fP

\fIclock\fP a pointer to a \fBClock\fP object used for a simulation\&. 
.br
\fIname\fP the name of the Mobile Operator\&. 
.br
\fIprobMobilePhone\fP represents the probability for a person to have a mobile phone subscribed to this company\&. 
.br
\fIoutputDir\fP a string representing the name of the directory where the output files are written\&.
