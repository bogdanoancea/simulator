.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This class represents a Mobile Operator company\&. Currently a simulation can be run with 1 or 2 mobile operators\&. A mobile operator own a set of antennas and has a set of mobile phone subscribed\&.

.SS "MobileOperator::MobileOperator (const \fBMap\fP * m, const unsigned long id, const \fBClock\fP * clock, const char * name, const double probMobilePhone, const string & outputDir)"
Constructor of this class\&. It builds a \fBMobileOperator\fP object with the characteristics provided by user through parameters\&. It builds a string representing the name of the file where the coverage area of all the antennas that belong to this \fBMobileOperator\fP are saved in \&.csv format and then open this file and writes the header of the file\&. The name of this file is built concatenating 'AntennaCells_' with the name of the Mobile Operator\&. The extension of the file is '\&.csv'\&. A line of this file contains the antenna id followed by a wkt text representing the coverage area of antenna\&. It also builds another string representing the name of a file where the signal quality values for all antennas that belong to this \fBMobileOperator\fP are saved\&. The signal quality is computed in the center of each tile of the \fBGrid\fP object set for a simulation\&. The file is opened and then it writes the header of the file\&. The name of this file is built concatenating 'SignalQuality_' with the name of the Mobile Operator\&. The extension of the file is '\&.csv'\&. A line of this file contains the antenna id followed by a set of values for the signal quality computed in the center of each tile of the grid\&.

\fIid\fP the id of the \fBMobileOperator\fP object\&. 
.br
\fIclock\fP a pointer to a \fBClock\fP object used for a simulation\&. 
.br
\fIname\fP the name of the Mobile Operator\&. 
.br
\fIprobMobilePhone\fP represents the probability that a person will have a cell phone at this company\&.
