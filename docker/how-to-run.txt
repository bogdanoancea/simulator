Here are some simple commands to run the docker image of the mobile network simulation software.
If you work under Windows, simply replace CURRENT_DIR variable with the current working directory. Under a Unix-like OS the name of the working directory
can be obtained with the command below.
In the working directory you should have a subdirectory named "output" where the configuration files simulation.xml, persons.xml, antennas.xml, probabilities.xml and map.wkt can be found. 
The output files are also saved in this subdirectory.

To run a simulation, open a terminal and run the following commands:

$CURRENT_DIR=`pwd`
$docker load -i simulator.tar
$docker run  --rm -v $CURRENT_DIR/output:/repo/output -t -i simulator -m output/map.wkt -s output/simulation.xml -p output/persons.xml -a output/antennas.xml -v -pb output/probabilities.xml


If you want to build your own docker image we provide a Dockerfile and the Linux executable in "to-build" directory. 
The image can be built with the following command:
$docker build -t=simulator .
